## About
Iterators, generators and dunder methods. this is a short introduction as to what can be possible with Python

## Dunder methods
special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__. 

## Iterators
An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.

## Generators 
 A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values
